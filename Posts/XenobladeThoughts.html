						<hr/>
                        <p>
						I wasn't a fan of the original <i>Xenoblade</i>, and a lot of the issues with that game have 
						carried over into the sequel. The combat is too simple, the characters are built atop a mountain
						of tropes, and the multitude of quests carry the same tedium you'd commonly find in an MMO.
						Despite all of that, the 70 hours I poured into this game passed by in a blink. Even with the
						main story completed, it's still a joy to freely roam around the gorgeous environments populated
						across Mira. The game's world is filled to the brim with secrets. Of all that could be said
						about it, this game nails the formula of stumbling into an area and gradually depleting the supply
 						of treasure from its every knook and cranny.
						</p>
						<p>
						In my mind, the changes done to player movement have allowed X to succeed where the original failed.
						Your character does an instant zero to sixty the moment you hit the sprint button and can leap high
						enough to scale a three story building. This struck me as a bit comical the first time I saw it,
						especially for my character who adorns the sad clown makeup as his war paint.

						<br/>
						<p>
						Yet there's no denying how amazingly fluid this feels. Every point of interest spotted way off
						in the horizon can be reached in a matter of seconds. This holds true for scaling large structures
						as well. Many of the walls and cliffsides seen in the environment contain small outcroppings of
						footholds that can be jumped on, turning areas that seem tantalizingly out of reach into puzzles
						waiting to be solved. This makes it all too easy to deviate from the path leading to the main 
						objective and chase down the endless rabbit hole that comprises this game's amount of optional 
						content.
						</p>
						<p>
						But as much as I love getting sidetracked, I eventually found my way back to the main questline.
						This is where the game loses a lot of its steam. The plot itself is interesting enough: the remnants
						of human society have crash landed on an alien planet where the scarcity of resources has turned every
						thought toward survival. It's just the delivery of this narrative that puts me to sleep. Between the
						recycled jokes and stale dialogue, I can't think of a single character who stands out strongly enough
						to be worth mentioning. On top of that, the urgency in the world never feels reflected in the interactions
						between characters. The clock could be ticking down toward some doomsday event; but instead of a frenzied
						panic, dialogue is spoken with the same level of robotic calmness that's ever-present throughout the entirety
						of the game.

						</p>
						<p>
						Though it's not all doom and gloom. The combat and story might not be the best in the industry, but 
						<i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> is easily one of the best titles around when it comes to exploration. I can't
						recommend this game enough if you have a heart that loves to wonder. Getting lost in the expansiveness of a
						virtual world is one of the unique gifts the medium of games has to offer, and this box is definitely worth
						unwrapping. You just have to be mindful of the rough edges when investing yourself into the enormous world of Mira.
