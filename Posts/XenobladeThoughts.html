                        <h1>Thoughts on Xenoblade Chronicles X</h1>
						<hr/>
                        <p>
						I wasn't a fan of the original <i>Xenoblade</i>, and a lot of the issues with that game have 
						carried over into the sequel. The combat is too simple, the characters are built atop a mountain
						of tropes, and the multitude of quests carry the same tedium you'd commonly find in an MMO.
						Despite all of that, the 70 hours I poured into this game passed by in a blink. Even with the
						main story completed, it's still a joy to freely roam around the gorgeous environments populated
						across Mira. The game's world is filled to the brim with secrets. Of all that could be said
						about it, <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> nails the formula of stumbling into an area and gradually depleting the supply
 						of treasure from its every nook and cranny.
						</p>
						<p>
						In my mind, the changes done to player movement have allowed X to succeed where the original failed.
						Your character does an instant zero to sixty the moment you hit the sprint button and can leap high
						enough to scale a three story building. This struck me as a bit comical the first time I saw it,
						especially for my character who adorns the sad clown makeup as his war paint.
						</p>

						<br/>
						<p>
						Yet there's no denying how amazingly fluid this feels. Every point of interest spotted way off
						in the horizon can be reached in a matter of seconds. This holds true for scaling large structures
						as well. Many of the walls and cliffsides seen in the environment contain small outcroppings of
						footholds that can be jumped on, turning areas that seem tantalizingly out of reach into puzzles
						waiting to be solved. This makes it all too easy to deviate from the path leading to the main 
						objective and chase down the endless rabbit hole that comprises this game's amount of optional 
						content.
						</p>
						<p>
						And of course, the main selling-point of <i>Xenoblade</i> is how skells play into this mechanic. Skells are
						essentially Gundam suits that become available half way through the game. They allow you to jump higher,
						fight bigger monsters, and they transform into a car whenever you initiate a run. This sudden spike
						of mobility gives access to the final two continents of Mira, so the playground nearly doubles in size the
						moment you're allowed to romp around in a robot suit. Lining up these two events makes the game play like a
						dream. Before this point, you're prevented from exploring certain parts of the world through the use of impossibly strong monsters 
						who will end you in a single strike if you traipse around on their territory. But the sheer amount of speed and 
						control you have with a skell makes it possible to escape these danger zones before receiving that fateful 
						blow. In a way, this turns exploration into a non-stop high speed chase. Managing to escape this constant chain
						of death rewards you with endgame wealth once you can find a sufficient hideout, so the final result feels
						mischievously worthwhile if you can survive to see its conclusion.
						</p>
						<p>
						But as much as I love getting sidetracked, I eventually found my way back to the main questline.
						This is where the game loses a lot of its steam. The plot itself is interesting enough: the remnants
						of human society have crash landed on an alien planet where the scarcity of resources has turned every
						thought toward survival. It's just the delivery of this narrative that puts me to sleep. Between the
						recycled jokes and stale dialogue, I can't think of a single character who stands out strongly enough
						to be worth mentioning. On top of that, the urgency in the world never feels reflected in the interactions
						between characters. The clock could be ticking down toward some doomsday event; but instead of a frenzied
						panic, dialogue is spoken with the same level of robotic calmness that's ever-present throughout the entirety
						of the game.
						</p>
						<p>
						However, it's worth noting how much more alive these characters feel during combat. The battle system is a variant of
						what you'd commonly find in MMOs like <i>World of Warcraft</i> where you're constantly cycling through a set of abilities. Once used,
						spells go on cooldown and must be cast in a specific order to gain their full effect. You're only allowed to equip eight
						spells before initiating combat, so blowing through all of your abilities at once will often leave you with nothing to do for
						long stretches of time. The MMO genre typically addresses this gap by giving the player anywhere on the order from dozens
						to hundreds of spells to make it so there's always something to do, but player's have to use their best judgement to determine
						which ability is most worthwhile for their current situation. The <i>Xenoblade</i> series eschews this complexity by 
						relying on what it calls the soul voice mechanic. During battle, party members will periodically request for certain
						abilities to be used via a voice over. For example, destroying a monster's appendage will proc a soul voice from a random
						party member which could request anything from crippling the enemy with a debuff to closing in on them with melee attacks.
						If you or any of your other party members respond to a soul voice, you'll be rewarded with a party-wide heal, boost to TP
						(<i>Xenoblade's</i> version of mana), and a bonus effect to that spell. This incentivizes the player to wait before
						using up all of their abilities in a particular category and provides opportunities to
						alter their strategies in the midst of combat. A soul voice could potentially request a ranged attack
						while you're in the midst of a melee combo, so you'd have to choose between the bonuses from responding
						to the soul voice or finishing your preconceived chain of attacks. Additionally, these voice overs work in concert with the high
						intensity battle music to add a great deal of energy and fun to combat. They also yield insight on how certain characters
						feel about each other as there are many party combinations consisting of characters who never interact with each other
						during the cutscenes in story/affinity missions.
						</p>
						<p>
						There's a lot of potential for complexity within this system. The game provides a menu detailing out every party member's
						percent chance of procing each type of soul voice and allows you to assign which skills they can use during combat. Pairing
						these two concepts together provokes an interesting question: should skills be chosen based on their active effects or
						their likelihood to satisfy a soul voice? With 19 party members to choose from and 8 abilities per character along with 4 passive
						skills, there is an enormous amount of variety to play with when building a party. The issue is what happens after you settle 
						upon a build. Despite the immense possibility space that exists outside of combat, the optimal style of play is achieved by fulfilling a niche role within
						your party. My own setup focused entirely on melee attacks, so 5 of my 8 slots were dedicated to melee abilities and my party members had a high
						chance of asking me to use them. Regardless of the party composition chosen, maximizing the chance a soul voice will ask you to do something you had already
						planned on doing grants you the largest amount of bonuses in exchange for the least amount of fun. It falls into the trap of the RPG genre where
						players end up making the same decisions in a seemingly infinite loop, removing all of the variety found in the early section of the game.
						This all comes back to the problem of only allocating 8 abilities with an MMO combat system. Limiting the player to so few choices makes the
						decisions made before combat extremely interesting, but the end result doesn't have a satisfactory payoff.
						</p>
						<p>
						Though it's not all doom and gloom. The combat and story might not be the best in the industry, but 
						<i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> is easily one of the best titles around when it comes to exploration. I can't
						recommend this game enough if you have a heart that loves to wander. Getting lost in the expansiveness of a
						virtual world is one of the unique gifts the medium of games has to offer, and this box is definitely worth
						unwrapping. You just have to be mindful of the rough edges when investing yourself into the enormous world of Mira.
